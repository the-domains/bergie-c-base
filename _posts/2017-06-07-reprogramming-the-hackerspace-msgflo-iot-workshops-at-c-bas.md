  This July we're organizing a hack weekend around MsgFlo and Flowhub. This will
  focus on reprogramming the Internet of Things setup of the hackerspace. The
  aim is to connect more devices at the spaces to the MsgFlo environment, and
  come up with new connections between systems, and ways to visualize them.
