# USB dead drop publishing via IPFS

When you plug a USB memory into the device it will automatically access the memory stick and publish all the files on the web. It does so using the [InterPlanetary File System][0] (IPFS). Thanks to IPFS the files are instantly available to the whole world.

When the IPFS dead drop is finished uploading it opens a web page that displays a QR code that contains the IPFS address of your files. Just scan that and share the address with anyone.
